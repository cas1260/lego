Title: Subclassed Menu
Description: This code programatically creates a regular menu on a form using API's, then handles menu clicks using the SetWindowLong and CallWindowProc API's. If you add a menu item at run time you cannot access it within your regaulr code you have to subclass the menu. This shows how to do that. I have seen some submissions with the system menu but did not see one for a regular menu.
